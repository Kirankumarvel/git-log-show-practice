# 🔍 Exploring Git Commit History with `git log` and `git show`

## 📖 Description

This project is a simple Git-based exercise designed to help you understand how to navigate and inspect commit history using two fundamental Git commands: `git log` and `git show`.

By working with this repository, you will learn how to:
- View detailed commit history using `git log`.
- Analyze specific changes made in each commit using `git show`.
- Understand commit hashes, author information, timestamps, and change diffs.
- Explore practical examples of version control on real GitHub projects.

---

## 🔧 Commands Covered

- **`git log`**: View the complete commit history of the repository.
- **`git log -p -n`**: Display the last `n` commits along with their changes.
- **`git show <commit-hash>`**: Show the detailed changes introduced in a specific commit.

---

## 💡 Example Practice

Clone this repository or any open-source project and try the following:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/Kirankumarvel/git-log-show-practice.git
cd git-log-show-practice

# View commit history
git log

# View changes in a specific commit
git show <commit-hash>
```

Use this project as your sandbox to practice and explore how Git tracks changes and how to inspect them effectively.
